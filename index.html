	  	<p id="bio-text">My background is in arts and education. I taught art workhops to young children for many years, and also worked as a teaching assistant in both private and public schools. I have a passion for education and visual design.
		<br><br>
		I believe the internet is both the greatest art canvas and the most accessible educational tool of our times; and now I am transitioning out of teaching and into web development. </p>
	  	<p>Currently, I am completing an online Instructional Design and Technology masters degree program at West Texas A&amp;M University. Previously, I received my bachelors degree from Smith College with a focus in Arts and Technology.<br>
